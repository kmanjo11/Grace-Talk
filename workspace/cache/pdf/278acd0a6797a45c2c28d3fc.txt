# 1.6 NETWORK SYSTEM FORMAT

A. Format Requirements: The system shall consist of time scaled logic diagrams and specified reports.

B. Network Diagrams: Show the order and interdependence of activities and the sequence in which the work is to be accomplished as planned. The basic concept of a network analysis diagram will be followed to show how the start of a given activity is dependent on the completion of preceding activities and how its completion restricts or restrains the start of following activities. Diagrams shall be organized by Area Code and sorted by Early Start Date and will show a continuous flow from left to right with no logic (relationship lines) from right to left. With the exception of the Contract Award, Project Start, Notices to Proceed, and Project Completion milestone activities, no activities will be open-ended; each activity will have predecessor and successor ties. The diagram shall clearly show the activities of the critical path. Once an activity exists on the schedule it may not be deleted and must remain in the logic. No more than twenty (20%) percent of the activities may be on the critical path or near critical. Critical activities are defined as having zero days of Total Float. "Near critical" activities are defined as having Total Float in the range of one to fourteen (1-14) calendar days. Show the following information on the diagrams for each activity:

1. Activity ID
2. Activity Description
3. Original Duration in Work Days
4. Remaining duration
5. Actual Duration in Work Days
6. Early Start Date
7. Early Finish Date
8. Total Float
9. Late Start Date
10. Late Finish Date

C. Printed Copies of Network Diagrams: Provide network diagrams on ANSI E sheets. Updated diagrams shall show the date of the latest revision.

D. Schedule Activity Properties and Level of Detail: Numbering shall be assigned so that, in general, predecessor activity numbers are smaller numerically than the successor activity numbers. Skip numbering shall be used on the network to allow insertion of additional activities for contract modifications and logic changes. The number of construction activities in the final
