It is the intent of the Government that an alternate dispute resolution process be established as a part of the partnering meeting and agreement in order to encourage both parties to resolve potential disputes in a constructive manner and to avoid litigation whenever possible.
2. Frequency: The first workshop session shall be conducted within forty-five (45) calendar days after the date of the issuance of the NTP and it shall be a one (1) day workshop of approximately eight (8) hours.
