The Government will also review for contract imposed schedule constraints and conformance, and cost loading of the CPM activities. Comments offered on other parts of the schedule, which the Contractor is assigned responsibility, are offered as a courtesy and are not conditions of Government acceptance; but are for the general conformance with established industry schedule concepts.\n\nB. Schedule Acceptance Prior to Start of Work: The Construction NAS must be submitted thirty (30) calendar days prior to restorative Work. However, the Contractor may proceed with other select non\u2011restorative work i.e. construction office build out, temporary protection, hoist and chutes, fencing, demising walls. The Baseline NAS described in the paragraph entitled \"Baseline NAS\" must be submitted and accepted by the Government before the Contractor will be allowed to start work on the construction stage(s) of the contract. Examples of construction stages are, but not limited to; demolition, site work and restorative work.\n\nC. Acceptance: When the Construction NAS is submitted and accepted by the CO, it will then be considered the \"Baseline NAS\".
